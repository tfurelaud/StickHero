# StickHero
This game has been developed by using the pygame library. It's an easy way to develop it. 
It is not finished yet (Game Over screen, start screen,...).
To start the game, you just have to execute the.By file (python3 StickHero. pi).

## How To Play
To make the stick grow, you just have to press the space button. 
When your ninja is moving, you can press space to make him flip.
If you touch the cherry, it's a +5. 
But be careful, if you haven't flipped again your ninja before the second platform come, you lost. 
If the stick fall right in the red block it's a +2.
